## 🚀 About Me

I’m an AI developer and ML engineer focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**,  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **production-ready AI systems**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- applied machine learning
- cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform)
- knowledge systems (RAG, vector search, structured data)
- and real industrial / educational use cases

I enjoy turning **messy real-world data** (documents, logs, transcripts, manuals)  
into **usable AI products**.
